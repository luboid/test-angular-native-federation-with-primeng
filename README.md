# test-angular-native-federation-with-primeng

Angular 18, @angular-architects/native-federation, PrimeNg

Here I'm failing to add PrimeNg in right way

Test case is based on example in [@angular-architects/native-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation?activeTab=readme)

Install npm moudles: `npm i`

Run in parallel: `ng serve mfe1 -o`, `ng serve shell -o`
